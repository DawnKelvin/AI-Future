## 📌 Problem Statement

Global carbon emissions remain above safe thresholds, and climate mitigation efforts alone are unlikely to meet the 1.5°C goal. One proposed geoengineering solution is **Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI)**—releasing reflective particles into the upper atmosphere to reflect sunlight. However, traditional SAI models lack real-time feedback, risking unintended climate side effects, ethical dilemmas, and geopolitical tensions.

## 💡 Proposed Solution: SAOS

The **Stratospheric Aerosol Optimization System (SAOS)** is an AI-powered, real-time decision-support platform to guide safe, equitable, and adaptive deployment of SAI. It simulates climate impacts, manages uncertainties, and recommends injection strategies that minimize harm while achieving temperature control targets.

## 🧠 AI Workflow

### **🔢 Data Inputs**

* Satellite and atmospheric sensor data (e.g., temperature, aerosol concentration)
* Historical climate records and real-time forecasts
* Agricultural and ecological impact indicators
* Socio-political risk indices (e.g., water stress, migration trends)

### **🧮 Model Components**

* **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Adaptive policy control for injection timing and dosage
* **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Model regional interdependencies in climate impact
* **Bayesian Networks:** Probabilistic forecasting and uncertainty quantification

### **📤 Outputs**

* Optimal injection schedules (location, timing, volume, composition)
* Climate and risk projections with regional overlays
* Policy scenario simulations and ethics-informed recommendations

## ✅ Societal Benefits

* 🌡️ Stabilizes global temperatures
* 📊 Improves transparency and accountability in geoengineering governance
* 🔄 Minimizes risks through real-time AI feedback and control

---

## ⚠️ Societal Risks

* ⚖️ Uneven regional effects could spark equity and governance concerns
* 🛑 Moral hazard: Reduced urgency for emissions reductions
* 🧨 Potential for misuse, system failure, or geopolitical disputes

## 🧭 Conclusion

SAOS provides a future-forward, AI-driven framework for managing one of humanity’s most controversial but potentially necessary tools for climate stabilization. With global oversight and strong ethical governance, SAOS could help ensure responsible climate intervention by 2030.
